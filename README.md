Qoala-T is an advanced supervised-learning tool that streamlines quality assessment of MRI scans processed with FreeSurfer. By leveraging features extracted from FreeSurfer outputs, Qoala-T predicts the quality of automated segmentations, identifying scans that may require further manual inspection. This innovative tool enhances the efficiency and reliability of quality control processes, particularly in large-scale neuroimaging studies, by providing consistent and reproducible evaluations of scan quality.
